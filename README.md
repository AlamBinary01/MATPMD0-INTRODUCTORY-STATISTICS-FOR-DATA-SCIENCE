PROJECT   :    	AUTUMN SEMESTER 2022
			Submission due 19th December 17:00


Student Number: <Student id>

Declaration: In submitting this project I declare that this is all my own work and I did not seek help to complete it.



For each project question, insert answers below.


1. Perform an exploratory data analysis, taking care to describe the type of variables in the data set. 

<Enter answer here>


2. Calculate the correlation coefficient for the two variables given and comment on the relationship between body fat and abdomen size. 

<Enter answer here>


3. Investigate a model to test the relationship between body fat and abdomen size. You must include output from R to support your findings. Details you should include are: 
•	a description of the model; 
•	a summary of the fitted model with interpretation of test statistics and parameter estimates; 
•	evidence as to whether assumptions of the model have been met; 
•	conduct a formal test to question whether there is a significant linear relationship between body fat and abdomen size.

4. Use the equation to predict the percentage of body fat for a male whose abdomen measures 100cm.

5. Assess the predictive performance of the model.

6. In this final section include all R code that you have used for this project verbatim. Ensure that: 
•	the code for each question can be easily found;
•	all code is adequately commented;
•	variable names are sensible.
